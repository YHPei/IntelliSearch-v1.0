# Contributing to IntelliSearch

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🎉

**A quick note**: I'm not a professional programmer — I built this with AI's help as a learning project. So if you see something that could be better, **please don't hesitate to help!** Beginners teaching beginners is powerful. 🌱

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project is a **learning-focused demonstration** of how to:

1. Build an AI search engine in 10 minutes
2. Integrate SearchCans API for real-time search
3. Combine SERP data with LLM for intelligent answers
4. Show that non-programmers can build useful tools with AI assistance

**This is an educational project**, not a production-ready framework. Contributions that help others learn are especially welcome!

   - Add clearer explanations
   - Translate to your language

3. **✨ Suggest Features**
   - What would make this more useful?
   - How can we make it easier to learn from?

4. **🎨 UI/UX Improvements**
   - Make it prettier
   - Make it more intuitive
   - I'm not a designer, so this needs help!

5. **🧪 Code Improvements**
   - Better error handling
   - Performance optimizations
   - Cleaner code (teach me!)

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Open an issue** to discuss your idea (let's chat first!)
2. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
3. **No pressure** — even small improvements are valuable!

### Code Standards (Don't Stress!)

**Python (Backend)**
- Try to follow PEP 8 (but I won't judge if you don't)
- Add comments explaining what your code does
- Test it locally before submitting

**JavaScript (Frontend)**
- Make sure it works in a modern browser
- Comment anything that isn't obvious
- Keep it simple — I need to understand it too!

**The most important rule**: If it works and helps others learn, it's good enough!

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
✅ Good:
"Add support for Bing search engine"
"Fix SearchCans API timeout handling"
"Update README with new features"

❌ Bad:
"update"
"fix bug"
"changes"
```
